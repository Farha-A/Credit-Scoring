        "\n",
        "**XGBoost** is a highly optimized, scalable implementation of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), widely used for structured/tabular data due to its performance and flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔧 Key Features:\n",
        "- **Regularization**: Incorporates L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties to control overfitting.\n",
        "- **Parallel & Distributed Training**: Utilizes hardware-efficient parallelism for fast training.\n",
        "- **Tree Pruning**: Uses gain and cover-based splitting to reduce unnecessary model complexity.\n",
        "- **Handling Missing Data**: Learns optimal default directions for missing values during training.\n",
        "- **Custom Loss Functions**: Allows defining specialized objectives for tasks like ranking and survival analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Strengths:\n",
        "- State-of-the-art accuracy on structured data.\n",
        "- Versatile: Supports classification, regression, and ranking.\n",
        "- Scales efficiently to large datasets.\n",
        "- Offers built-in feature importance measures (e.g., weight, gain, cover).\n",
        "\n",
        "⚠️ Weaknesses:\n",
        "- Sensitive to hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, max depth).\n",
        "- Less interpretable than simpler models.\n",
        "- Can be memory-intensive with very high-dimensional data (e.g., text features in NLP).\n",
