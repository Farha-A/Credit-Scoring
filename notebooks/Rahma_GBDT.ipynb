        "### Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "**Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)** is a powerful ensemble learning technique that builds a series of decision trees sequentially. Each new tree is trained to correct the prediction errors made by the previous ones, using gradient descent to minimize a specified loss function.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🔑 Key Features:\n",
        "- **Boosting:** Trees are added iteratively, focusing on instances the previous trees misclassified.\n",
        "- **Regularization:** Helps prevent overfitting through control parameters such as tree depth, learning rate, and subsampling.\n",
        "- **Versatility:** Applicable to regression, classification, and ranking problems.\n",
        "- **Feature Importance:** Provides insight into which features contribute most to model predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ⚙️ Popular Implementations:\n",
        "- **XGBoost**: Optimized for speed and performance.\n",
        "- **LightGBM**: Designed for high efficiency with large datasets.\n",
        "- **CatBoost**: Natively handles categorical features and reduces the need for extensive preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ✅ Strengths:\n",
        "- High predictive accuracy\n",
        "- Handles both numerical and categorical data\n",
        "- Robust to outliers and missing values\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ⚠️ Weaknesses:\n",
        "- Training can be slower compared to Random Forests\n",
        "- Requires careful hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance\n"
